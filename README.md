# The Principla Path Method

The landscape of digital assets and blockchain technology has rapidly evolved, introducing concepts such as smart contracts, stablecoins, tokens, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and other web3 technologies. These advancements have expanded the definition of assets, markets, and economies. Digital assets are no longer limited to payment tokens or stores of value; they now encompass works of art, virtual real estate, and entertainment assets.

These new assets pose challenges for financial reporting, both conceptual and methodological. One such challange is _fair value_ pricing. When measuring assets in an exchange at fair value, a __principal market__ must be identified. According to current accounting standards (FASB 2011; IASB 2011), typically the market with the greatest volume and level of activity for the asset. In this market the asset is traded against a fiat currency and priced accordingly. 

In the universe of digital assets,trading is global and happens across many differnt venues without a specific venue dominating any of the others. Moreover, most trasnactions are swaps of digital assets against other digital assets, this is true even if one of these assets is a stablecoin. Even for assets that trade againt fiat currencies it is often the case that a small fraction of the volume is converted to fiat (on/off ramping) while the real driver are digital to digital swaps. With such fragmented markets, it clearly becomes impossible to apply existing standards to reflect market realities.

The __Principal Path Method__ is to dynamically identify a principal market and once that market is obtained, source all price information from that market. The identification is a continuous process driven by volumes, market dynamcs and freshness of data.
