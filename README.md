# The Principla Path Method

The landscape of digital assets and blockchain technology has rapidly evolved, introducing concepts such as smart contracts, stablecoins, tokens, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and other web3 technologies. These advancements have expanded the definition of assets, markets, and economies. Digital assets are no longer limited to payment tokens or stores of value; they now encompass works of art, virtual real estate, and entertainment assets.

These new assets pose challenges for financial reporting, both conceptual and methodological. One such challange is _fair value_ pricing. When measuring assets to be used in exchange at fair value, a __principal market__ must be identified (FASB, 2011; International Accounting Standards Board [IASB], 2011). According to current accounting standards, the principal market is the market with the greatest volume and level of activity for the asset (FASB 2011; IASB 2011). The fair value of the asset would be measured using the price that would be received in that market. 

The main objective of our model is to dynamically identify the principal market and once that market is obtained, source all price information employed either as a spot or as a bench- mark from that exchange.1
Specifically, ASC 820 (FASB, 2011) indicates that if there is a principal market for the asset or liability, the fair value measurement shall represent the price in that market (whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique), even if the price in a different market is potentially more advantageous at the measurement date. Moreover, to be relevant, the benchmark price should be at least approximately trad- able on an accessible market.
