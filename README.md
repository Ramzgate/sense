# The Principla Path Method

The definition of fair value for financial reporting is based on an exit price concept. The exit or exchange price is defined as the price that can be obtained on the disposal of an asset or the amount paid for the transfer of an obligation in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The concept of an orderly transaction assumes that the hypothetical transaction used to measure fair value will be one in which the seller of an asset or the transferor of an obligation has the usual access to markets and would not assume a forced sale as in the case of a liquidation or bankruptcy.
When measuring assets to be used in exchange at fair value, we must identify the princi- pal market (FASB, 2011; International Accounting Standards Board [IASB], 2011). Only if a principal market cannot be identified, then the most advantageous market should be used. As is the case of cryptocurrencies, assets may be traded in different, active markets at dif- ferent prices. If an entity enters into transactions in multiple markets and can access prices in those markets for the asset at the measurement date, then those markets can be assessed in terms of volume and level of activity.
According to current accounting standards, the principal market is the market with the greatest volume and level of activity for the asset (FASB 2011; IASB 2011). The fair value of the asset would be measured using the price that would be received in that market. The main objective of our model is to dynamically identify the principal market and once that market is obtained, source all price information employed either as a spot or as a bench- mark from that exchange.1
Specifically, ASC 820 (FASB, 2011) indicates that if there is a principal market for the asset or liability, the fair value measurement shall represent the price in that market (whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique), even if the price in a different market is potentially more advantageous at the measurement date. Moreover, to be relevant, the benchmark price should be at least approximately trad- able on an accessible market.
