# The Principla Path Method

The landscape of digital assets and blockchain technology has rapidly evolved, introducing concepts such as smart contracts, stablecoins, tokens, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and other web3 technologies. These advancements have expanded the definition of assets, markets, and economies. Digital assets are no longer limited to payment tokens or stores of value; they now encompass works of art, virtual real estate, and entertainment assets.

These new assets pose challenges for financial reporting, both conceptual and methodological. One such challange is _fair value_ pricing. When measuring assets to be used in exchange at fair value, a __principal market__ must be identified. According to current accounting standards (FASB 2011; IASB 2011), the principal market is the market with the greatest volume and level of activity for the asset. The fair value of the asset would be measured using the price that would be received in that market.

In the universe of digital assets, assets are traded globally, across many differnt venues without any secific venue dominating any of the others. With these fragmented markets, it is impossible to determine how existing standards can be used to reflect market realities.

The main objective of our model is to dynamically identify the principal market and once that market is obtained, source all price information employed either as a spot or as a bench-mark from that exchange. The identification is a continuous process driven by volumes, market dynamcs and freshness of data.
